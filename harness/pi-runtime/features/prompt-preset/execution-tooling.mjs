// Execution-tooling stance shared by the Claude and Kimi presets. The eval tool
// description already teaches cell mechanics per dialect and the terminal prompt
// already documents monitor; this module carries the ROUTING decision those
// descriptions cannot make for the model - eval is the default surface for any
// multi-call step - and renders only when eval is actually selected. Dialects
// follow the prompt-engineering references: Claude takes a tagged block with
// uppercase key verbs; Kimi takes positive DO-framing with terminal conditions
// and no all-caps NEVER (the K2.6 guidance says prohibitions make it overthink).
//
// The wait-as-subscription stance lives in the eval tool description instead:
// `monitor` is reachable only through an eval cell, so a rule gated on it being
// directly selected could never render, and only the description can teach the
// `tool.monitor(...)` form the model must actually type.
