## Persistent terminal sessions

The \`bash\` tool is PTY-backed. For long-running or interactive work, do NOT use tmux or
manual \`&\` backgrounding — use the built-in session tools:

- \`${bash}({ command, run_in_background: true })\` starts a persistent session and returns a
  \`bash_id\` immediately. Foreground calls still block and return output; their \`timeout\`
  (seconds) is a kill deadline. Background sessions ignore \`timeout\` and live until they
  exit or you call \`kill_bash\`.
- \`bash_output({ bash_id, filter, view })\` peeks at a session without blocking: new output
  since the last read, the status line, or a rendered full-screen snapshot of TUIs via
  \`view: "screen"\`. Completion arrives as a notification carrying the exit code and output
  tail — peeking is for steering, never for waiting.
- \`${monitor}\` subscribes you to a change. Pass \`command\` XOR \`path\` — one branch per call,
  never both:
  - \`${monitor}({ description, command, filter?, timeout_ms?, persistent? })\` watches a command:
    newline-terminated PTY output lines (stderr included) matching \`filter\` arrive as injected
    events while you keep working; command exit always delivers a summary. One-shot gate: wait
    inside the command and print one sentinel (\`until <cond>; do sleep 1; done;
    printf 'READY\\n'\`). Stream: \`tail -n 0 -F | grep --line-buffered\`. Filter noise at the
    source and stop with \`kill_bash\`.
  - \`${monitor}({ description, path, event? })\` natively watches one regular file and fires once —
    prefer it over a shell poll loop. \`"create"\` (the default) fires only when the file appears
    after registration, so watch an already-existing file with \`"modify"\`; registration needs the
    parent directory to exist already, so poll with a \`command\` when the run creates that
    directory too. This branch takes no \`filter\` and no \`persistent\`.
  Identical updates are deduped; repeated monitor-only wakes pause the noisy monitor(s) that
  caused them, not all monitors. Completion still wakes the session, and
  \`${monitor}({ action: "rearm", bash_id })\` resumes one while \`${monitor}({ action: "rearm" })\`
  resumes all paused monitors; real user input also resumes paused monitors.
- \`bash_input({ bash_id, input, keys, submit })\` sends stdin or named keys (e.g.
  \`["ctrl+c"]\`, \`["enter"]\`) to steer a REPL or interrupt a process.
- \`bash_resize({ bash_id, cols, rows })\` resizes the PTY so full-screen programs reflow.
- \`kill_bash({ bash_id })\` (or \`{ all: true }\`) tears the session tree down with no orphans.
